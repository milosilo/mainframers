## Mainframers IBM Cybersecurity RPG

### Overview

Mainframers, Sneakers-Inspired Mainframers Cybersecurity RPG is an educational text-based role-playing game (RPG) that aims to teach players about IBM mainframe penetration testing and cybersecurity. Inspired by the classic 1981 video game "Sneakers," the game merges nostalgia and education, offering hands-on, real-world simulations.

### Objectives

1. Teach key cybersecurity concepts related to IBM mainframes.
2. Provide a hands-on approach to learning through realistic simulations.
3. Enhance user engagement with an immersive storyline and game mechanics.

### Gameplay

#### Starting the Game
Upon starting the game, players are greeted with an introduction that sets the stage and explains the objective of mastering IBM mainframe cybersecurity skills. 

#### Main Menu
The main menu offers players options to:
- Start a New Game
- Load a Saved Game
- Exit the Game

#### Game Structure
The game consists of a series of "rooms," each representing a different area of mainframe cybersecurity. Players must navigate these rooms, fulfilling missions that are realistic simulations of real-world tasks.

-RACF Management Room: 
Designed like a cybersecurity operations center, this room focuses on Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) management. Players decrypt messages using RACF commands.

-JCL Room: 
Resembling a hackerâ€™s den, this room is all about Job Control Language (JCL). Players use JCL commands to bypass security walls.

-FTP Security Room: 
Modeled after a secure data transfer facility, this room centers on File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS). Players work on securely transferring files.

-z/OS Security Room: 
A high-security vault that deals with z/OS security. Players work on unlocking a vault by implementing z/OS security best practices.

-ESM Configuration Room: 
Designed to look like an IBM mainframe console room, this room focuses on configuring an External Security Manager (ESM).

-Encryption Techniques Room: 
Styled like a cryptography lab, this room educates players on various encryption techniques. Players identify and implement encryption algorithms.

-Incident Response Room: 
A control room with multiple screens displaying real-time mainframe activity. Players identify and respond to security incidents following NIST guidelines.

-Final Room: 
The ultimate challenge room that tests all the skills acquired throughout the game. It has an immersive setting with a time-sensitive mission that involves multiple tasks.

#### Progression
Players move from one room to another by completing the mission in the current room. Each mission requires players to input realistic mainframe commands. Incorrect answers lead to hints or roadblocks, while correct answers allow the player to progress to the next room. 

#### Time-Sensitive Missions
Certain missions, like the final room, have a time constraint to add urgency and realism to the tasks.

#### Saving and Loading
The game allows players to save their progress at any point and load it later, providing flexibility and ease of use.

### Technical Implementation

#### Python
The game is written in Python, making it easy to run on most systems.

#### Libraries
The `colorama` library is used for text coloring to enhance readability and engagement.

### Conclusion

Mainframers, a Sneakers-Inspired Mainframe Cybersecurity RPG offers an interactive, educational experience that covers the A to Z of IBM mainframe cybersecurity. It serves as a valuable resource for both newcomers and professionals looking to improve their cybersecurity skills in an engaging manner.
